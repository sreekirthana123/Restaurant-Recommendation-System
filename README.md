# Restaurant-Recommendation-System
This project builds a content-based restaurant recommendation system using user preferences like cuisine type and price range. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. The system suggests restaurants based on user-selected criteria and tests recommendations using sample inputs.
